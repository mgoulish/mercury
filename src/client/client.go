  Package router implements a dispatch router.
  The normal order for operations on a router is:
    * create
    * connect to other routers
    * init
    * run
    * halt
  It is during the initialization step that the 
  configuration file is written that will be read at 
  router startup. So any connecting that you want to do
  should be done before you call Init.
  Every router is created with a normal-mode listener, so 
  you can always attach a client to it, or send it 
  management commands.
